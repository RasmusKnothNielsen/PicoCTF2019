# Handy shellcode

Q) This program executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_1_ebc60746fee43ae25c405fc75a234ef5 on the shell server. Source.

A) picoCTF{h4ndY_d4ndY_sh311c0d3_55c521fe}

Commentary:

To get acces to the file, we need shellcode. I found a python script that helps us with the access.
When we have the script, we need to upload it to our private folder on the picoCTF server.
We do the following from the server side after we have logged in to the server:
```
nc -l -p 12345 -q 1 > Handy_shellcode.py
```
The -l flag means that we place the server in a listener mode.
The -p flag is what port to listen on.
The -q flag defines how many seconds to wait for, with no input, before the connection is terminated.

And this from another terminal window that is working from a directory where our python script is:
```
cat Handy_shellcode.py | nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 12345
```

The result is that we upload the script to our own folder on the server, so we can execute it.
Now we just need to run the script:
```
python Handy_shellcode.py
```

And among other things, we get this beauty:
