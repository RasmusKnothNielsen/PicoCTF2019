# Pico browser

Q) This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32205/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32205

A) picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_ee951878}

Commentary:

This is alot like the former puzzle, Open_to_admins.

We know that we have to access the website with a specific browser, 
so we add this to a curl command:

```
curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32205/flag" -H "User-Agent: picobrowser" -s | grep pico
```

In the header flag, we tell the server that our User-Agent (Browser) is picobrowser, and thus we get the flag.
