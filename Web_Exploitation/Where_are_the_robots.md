Commentary:

Where are the robots is a reference to webcrawlers.

First a little info about the robot.txt file
```
The robots exclusion standard, also known as the robots exclusion protocol 
or simply robots.txt, is a standard used by websites to communicate with 
web crawlers and other web robots. The standard specifies how to inform the web 
robot about which areas of the website should not be processed or scanned. 
Robots are often used by search engines to categorize websites.

So when we try to go to the following link:
```
https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21868/robots.txt
```

We get this:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /e0779.html
```

This piqued our interest, so we try the following url:
```
https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21868/e0779.html
```

And lo and behold, here is the flag!
