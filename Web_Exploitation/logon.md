# Logon

Q) The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32270/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32270

Commentary:

To find the flag, we have to log in as Administrator. 
After some search, i found a cookie where the admin is set to be False. 
In Chrome, you can edit cookies in the browser and resend them, thus allowing you to 
set the Admin to true.

Go to Developertools -> application -> Cookies -> The cookie for the site, and change Admin from False to True
