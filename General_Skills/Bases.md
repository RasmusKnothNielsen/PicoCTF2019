# Bases
Q) What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

A) picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}

Commentary:

Since there are letters in the string, it can not be base2 or base10.
Since the letters are not only A-F, it can not be base16 (Hexadecimal) either.
When trying to decode it with Base64, it provides a reasonable result = l3arn_th3_r0p35.
