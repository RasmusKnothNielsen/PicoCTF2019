# General Notes

1)
    In the General Skills room there is something resembling morse code in the north east corner of the room.

    The morse code is the following:
    ```
    .--. .. .-.. .-...- .-. ..--- ....- .---- ...--
    ```

    Which is translated into:
    ```
    PILLAR2413
    ```

    I am not yet sure of what it is going to be used for, but it is probably a flag at some point.
