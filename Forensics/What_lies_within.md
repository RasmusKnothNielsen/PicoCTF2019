# What lies within

Q) Theres something in the building. Can you retrieve the flag?

A) picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}

Commentary:

When downloading the picture, we can upload it to a webservice that decodes pictures.
I used the following website:
https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/

And got the following flag back:

```
picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}
```

If you want to know more about how it was done, here is the respective Github repository:
