# Glory of the garden

Q) This garden contains more than it seems. You can also find the file in /problems/glory-of-the-garden_3_346e50df4a37bcc4aa5f6e5831604e2a on the shell server.

A) picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y35a97d3bB}

Commentary:

By downloading the image and doing a simple Strings command on it, we get the flag:

```
Strings garden.jpg
```

This returns amongst other lines, this one:
```
Here is a flag "picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y35a97d3bB}"
```
